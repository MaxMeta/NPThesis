The repository NPThesis stores python scripts mentioned in MSc thesis  'Creating a Natural Product Database and Generating Molecular Substructures'.

NPDatabase can be downloaded from:
www.dropbox.com/s/qumnikhiaszrwjh/NPDatabase.sqlite?dl=0

To install the molBLOCKS program:
https://github.com/kheikamp/modified_molBLOCKS

Download Top-down/NPRules.txt and upload the file in the main molBLOCKS directory. Now the progam can be used as described by K. Heikamp.

After the installation of the RDKit library, the scrips provided in the bottom-up directory can be used directly.
